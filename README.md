I'm a developer with 5+ years of hands-on experience building web apps, bots, APIs, games, and mobile software. I started off scripting with Lua and JavaScript — now I’m fluent in a wide range of tools and tech across both frontend and backend stacks. I build independently and through my studio, **Syde Swipe Studios, LLC**.
